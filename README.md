# React + Vite

2 Versions of this Portfolio are existing.

The Version on the main branch includes 3d models and alot of threeJS.
The amount of 3d models are conflicting with alot of browsers and mobile devices.
Heres the url for this version(works on edge): [aziz-portfolio-3d.netlify.app](https://aziz-portfolio-3d.netlify.app/)

The second version is completely without 3d models and is on the branch: "chrome-and-mobile-adjusted"
Heres the link(works on every browser and device): https://aziz-zai.de/
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
